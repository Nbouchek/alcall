## Architecture Patterns & Best Practices

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
```yaml
bounded_contexts:
  messaging:
    aggregates:
      - Conversation
      - Message
      - Participant
    value_objects:
      - MessageContent
      - MessageStatus
    entities:
      - Attachment
      - Reaction

  identity:
    aggregates:
      - User
      - Profile
      - Authentication
    value_objects:
      - Credentials
      - Permission
    entities:
      - Role
      - Session

  payment:
    aggregates:
      - Transaction
      - Wallet
      - Invoice
    value_objects:
      - Money
      - Currency
    entities:
      - PaymentMethod
      - Refund
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
```yaml
events:
  message:
    - MessageSent
    - MessageDelivered
    - MessageRead
    - MessageDeleted

  user:
    - UserRegistered
    - UserLoggedIn
    - UserUpdated
    - UserDeactivated

  payment:
    - PaymentInitiated
    - PaymentCompleted
    - PaymentFailed
    - RefundProcessed

event_handlers:
  MessageSent:
    - NotificationService
    - AnalyticsService
    - ArchiveService

  PaymentCompleted:
    - InvoiceService
    - NotificationService
    - AccountingService
```

### CQRS Pattern
```yaml
commands:
  message:
    - SendMessage
    - EditMessage
    - DeleteMessage
    
  user:
    - RegisterUser
    - UpdateProfile
    - ChangePassword

queries:
  message:
    - GetMessageHistory
    - SearchMessages
    - GetUnreadCount
    
  user:
    - GetUserProfile
    - GetOnlineStatus
    - GetActivityLog
```

## Data Governance & Privacy

### Data Classification
```yaml

  personal:
    sensitivity: high
    encryption: required
    retention: 2 years
    examples:
      - email
      - phone
      - address

  payment:
    sensitivity: critical
    encryption: required
    retention: 7 years
    examples:
      - credit_card
      - bank_account
      - transaction_history

  messaging:
    sensitivity: medium
    encryption: required
    retention: 1 year
    examples:
      - message_content
      - attachments
      - metadata
```

### Data Retention Policy
```yaml
retention_rules:
  messages:
    standard: 12 months
    encrypted: 24 months
    deleted: 30 days

  user_data:
    active: indefinite
    inactive: 24 months
    deleted: 30 days

  payment_data:
    transactions: 7 years
    payment_methods: until_deleted
    audit_logs: 10 years
```

### Privacy Controls
```yaml
privacy_settings:
  user_controls:
    - data_sharing_preferences
    - marketing_preferences
