# UnifiedChat Implementation Strategy

> **MANDATORY FOR ALL FEATURES:**
> 
> **Every service feature MUST be highly tested (unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, and security tests) and MUST meet ALL requirements as specified in both `README.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION.md`. No feature is considered complete until it passes all tests, meets all requirements, and is fully documented and reviewed. This is a non-negotiable requirement for every feature and service.**

This document outlines the detailed implementation strategy for the UnifiedChat platform, following the specifications in the README.md. The implementation is divided into phases with clear deliverables and timelines.
